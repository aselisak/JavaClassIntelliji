Method overloading in Java:
When same method name exists in a class but with different number of parameters or different data type of
parameters or different sequence of parameters.

Pros of method overloading:
  Flexibility of having same name methods in class
  End s user gets the benefit that he does not nee to remember different method name
  Cons :


  Rules:
  1.we overload the constructors
  2.we can overload the static method as well
  3.we can overload main method
  ----------------------------------
  4.Method should be same
  5.method signature (method name +parameter list) should be different
  6. we can't overload a method by just changing its return type
  7. we can't overload a method by just changing access modifiers(public, private etc)
  8. we can't overload a method by just changing non-access modifiers(static, default)


//If else conditions
//Loops
//Methods
//Constructors
//this keyword
//Access modifiers

Rules for static methods:
Static methods can't access instance fields directly
instance methods can access instance as well static directly

Method overriding:
1.Method overriding happens when we have same name methods in the parent class and in the child class
2.we can only override a method if we have inheritance relationship between two classes
3. we can't override the private methods they don't participate in inheritance
4.we can't t override the constructors because they don't participate in inheritance

Overloading and overriding very important
