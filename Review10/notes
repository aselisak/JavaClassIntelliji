Inheritnace in Java;
This is mechanism in Java through which one class can acquire the properties and methods from another class.
The class from which we acuire the properties is called parent/superclass/baseclass and the class which acquire
the properties and methods is called Child class/ derived class/ subclass

Advantages:
    1) Code duplication is reduced.
    2)Saves Memory
    3)Execution time is less

Disadvantages:
    1)Classes get tightly coupled. If we change something in the parent class it will affect all the children
    classes and we have to make sure that this new changes is compatible with the code that we have in the children
    classes.

Whe we should use Inheritance:
    1) If there is a case in which we would have to use the same methods in many different classes and the classes are
    closely related to each other the best practice would be to create a parent class and use it to extend the methods
    into the subclasses

Types of Inheritance:
We have four (4) types of Inheritance:
    1)Single
    2)Hierarchical
    3)Multilevel
    4)multiple

Single Inheritance:
In Single inheritance we have only one parent and only one child class.
Class Animal{
Stine name;
String color;
int age;
double weight;
}
Hierarchical inheritance:
In Hierarchical we have only one parent and many children classes.
Class Animal{
Stine name;
String color;
int age;
double weight;
}
class Dog extends Animal{
}
class Cat extend Animal{
}
Multilevel inheritance:
    If we have one parent and one child class and many intermediate classes it is called multilevel inheritance.
    CEO-->Manager-->Assisst Manager--> Senior Employee-->Junior Employee
    class Human{
    String name;
}
class Employee extends Human{
String employeeId;
}
class Teacher extends Employee{
String subjects
}
Multiple Inheritance:
In multiple inheritance we have a single child class and multiple parent classes: This is not supported in java with
classes but possible with the help of interfaces.
class Display{
int resolution;
}
class keyboard{
int noOfKeys;
}
class laptop extends Display, Keyboard{
}
Rules:
    1) Private members are not inherited (private fields and private methods)
    2) Constructors don't participate in inheritance
    3) If we have constructor in the parent class we must have a matching constructor in the children classes as well.
    4) in Java a subclass can only extend single parent class.
