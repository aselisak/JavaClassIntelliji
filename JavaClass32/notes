FileHandling in Java:
Reading and writing data to files is called file handling.
Things that we need to read/write data to files.
1. File path, location of our file on our computer
2. Navigate to that location we use FileInputStream if we are reading nad FileOutputStream
if we are writing a data.
3. A specific class that knows how to write/read data to a specific class for example for properties files
we use Properties and for Excel files we use XSSFWorkbook class
