Abstraction in java:
Hiding the implementation details and providing the functionality only
Two methods to achieve abstractions:
1. Abstract classes
2. Interfaces
    Abstract classes are classes with abstract keyword

    Interfaces:
Interfaces are the contracts that we create with the help of interface keyword.
How to decide which one to use:
1. Prefer the interfaces over abstract classes.
2. If two or more classes are closely related to each other go with
abstract classes for example if we have to create a lion class and horse we should go with abstract
classes and should create an animal abstract class. if two classes are not related to each other for
example Apple and Cloth class, we should create an interface for that like if we want to have a behaviour washAble

Encapsulation:
it is the fourth pilar of OOPS. it provides security and better control over the data of a class.
We create classes and inside those classes we create private fields and methods.
this methods are called getter and setter methods and we set and get the values of the class fields with the help of this methods
instead of accessing and modifying directly.
