Encapsulation
Encapsulation is hiding the class variables by making them private and providing getter setter methods
Benefits:
better control over the data and security

Collections Framework:
Collections Framework is a collection of interfaces and classes which have many methods to store and manipulate
the data.
String name;
Limitations of Array
    1.They are fixed in size once we have created an array we can't modify its size
    2. Arrays don't have built-in methods

Collections
    1. Dynamic in size
    2. They have built-in methods to manipulate the data
    3. Collections framework doesn't work with primitive datatype.
       We have to use the wrapper classes.
    4. when we convert th primitive data type to non-primitive we call it
Boxing:
int num=10;
Integer wrapper = new Integer(num);//boxing
Integer wrapper=num;//autoboxing

Double d =new Double(25.5);
double num4=d.doubleValue();//unboxing
double num5=d;//auto unboxing

In java when we make a class inherit from another class we are already doing multiple
inheritance because Object class is automatically inherited for all the classes.

Equals method when we overwrite it we can check for the equality of two objects
 with based on the fields of that class instead of addresses
