Collections Framework in Java:
collection of classes that help us manage and manipulate data in a better way
1. ArrayList
    a.this class has many built-in methods like add(); , remove();, clear(); etc.
    b. Dynamic and can adjust their size at run time

   ArrayList <String> arrayList - new ArrayList();
   ArrayList=> name of the class
   <>=diamond operator we specify the data Type
   Wrapper classes
   byte=>Byte
   short=>Short
   int => Integer
   double=>Double
   char=>Character

 why wrapper classes
 1. we get built-in methods
 2. a lot of frameworks don't support primitives
 when to use primitive:
 when we care about the memory because primitives occupy 4 times less memory as compared to wrapper
 2. performance
 when we should use wrapper:
 when we care about ease in coding
