Wrapper classes:
They are object types for all the primitive types. When we use the wrapper classes we get all the benefits of
classes and objects for example we can have built -in methods.
also generics works with only the classes.
Boxing in wrapper classes:

Boxing happens when we convert a primitive to corresponding wrapper type(class)
int num=10;
Integer num2=new Integer(num);//boxing

Unboxing when we convert wrapper object to a corresponding primitive type
Integer num2 = new Integer(10);
int num=num2.intValue();

Integer num=10;/autoboxing
int num2=num;// auto boxing

List(it is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by two classes ArrayList and LinkedList
1. We can store duplicate values in List
2. Insertion order is maintained.

When to use ArrayList:
if most of the operations are reading and storing new data and not shifting or changing the position of data
then we should go arrayList.

When to use LinkedList:
when most of the operations are related to changing the position of data or related to data shifting then
we should go with lInkedList
