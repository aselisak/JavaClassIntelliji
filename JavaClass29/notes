Set in Java:
    Set is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by many classes
    HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet
Properties of Set:
        All the Sets don't allow duplicates
    1.HashSet does not maintain the insertion order
    2.it is the fastest in all sets
    3.most widely used Set

LinkedHashSet
    1.Maintains the insertion order
    2.slower than HashSet but faster than TreeSet specially the insertions

TreeSet:
    1.Sorts the data in natural order. for number in increasing order and for alphabetical order
    2. it is slowest when it comes to store the data

When to use which type of Set"
If we don't care about insertion order and data being sorted always use HashSet
2. if we need the insertion order we(batch 12) don't have much choice we have to use LinkedHashSet
but if we don't care about the insertion order we can compare it with TreeSet
LinkedHashSet                vs                 TreeSet
Insertion is not slow                           Slowest insertion
Retrieval is super slow                         slower than HashSet but faster than LinkedHashSet
I Don't care about insertion order but, I care about retrieval speed which Set should use
HashSet
I care about insertion order, but I don't care about retrieval speed which Set I use?
LinkedHashSetIf
I want to have sorted data all the time?
TreeSet
