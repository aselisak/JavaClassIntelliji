Maps in Java:
      Map is an interface that allows us to store the data in key value pairs.
Benefits:
      1. we can store two values inside the maps
      2. Searching is very efficient in maps

Types of maps:
1. Hashmap  2. LinkedHashMap  3. TreeMap

HashMap:
     1. Insertion order is not maintained (downside)
     2. Insertion and retrieval is fastest
LinkedHashMap:
     1. Insertion order is maintained (upside)
     2. Insertion speed is same as HashMap but retrieval speed is slowest in all the maps
TreeMap:
     1. Data is sorted in natural order by default
     2. Insertion speed speed is slowest but retrieval is better than LinkedHashMap but slower than simple HashMAp
Rules:
We can't convert a collection to a map for example we can't convert a set to a Map
Duplicate keys is not allowed(keys have to be unique)

Map<String, String> students = new Map<>();
students.put("Yaz123", "Yazgul");
Set <String > set = new HashSet(students);
