Inheritance in Java:

It is a mechanism in java through which a child class gets the properties and methods from a parent class
benefits:
1) saves time to code
2) code duplication is reduced
3) execution time is faster

Disadvantages:
   Classes are tightly couples if we change something in parent class it is also changed in the child class.

   Types of inheritance:
   There are 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them
   1. Single
   2. Multi level inheritance
   3. Hierarchical
   4. Multiple (not supported in java)

   Single inheritance:
   In single inheritance we have only one child and one parent class. or only two classes participate in inheritance one as child one as a parent.
   class Parent{}
   class child extends Parent{}

   Hierarchical:
   In hierarchical inheritance we have a single Parent class and multiple child classes.
   class parent{}
   class Child extends Parent {}
   class child2 extends Parent{}

   Multilevel:
   We have multiple levels of inheritance for example if we have a class A B C class C will be inherited from B and B inherited from A
   Class A{}
   Class B extends A{}
   class C extends B{}

   Super Keyword:
super keyword is like the "this" it refers to the parent class object
for example we can access the fields method or constructors of parent class inside the child class suing this keyword.
