Constructors in Java:
Constructor in java are special block of code similar to methods that initialize the objects of the class:
Rules:
1. THey don't have return types not even void
2. Name of the constructor must be same as name of the class
3. Constructors cant have non access modifiers like static final etc.
4. We can use access modifier like public, private protected with constructor.
5. If we don't write a constructor in a class a default constructor is provided by compiler
6. We can have multiple constructors in the class but number of arguments sequence of arguments or type of arguments should be different
7. If we have multiple constructors then Java decide which constructor to call based on the parameters we pass

This keyword:"
It is a reserved keyword in Java that we can use to refer to instance variables methods or constructor of a class
1. "This" keyword is used to distinguish instance variables with local variables
2. we can use "this" to call the constructor of the class inside another constructor
3. we can use "this" keyword to call the methods of the class.
Rules:
1. this() should be the first line inside a constructor
2. this() can't be used inside methods
