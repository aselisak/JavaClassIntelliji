Maps in Java:
Itâ€™s data structure that allows us to store ke value pairs.
1. Searching is efficient.
2. we can use any types of keys like Double, String, Char etc. we are not restricted
 to integer based natural indexes

 There are many types of maps but, we will be discussing only four of them.
 1.HashMap      2.LinkedHashMap      3.Treemap    4.HashTable(old)

HashMao:
 1. HashMap is the fastest one when it comes to inserting and retrieving the data
 2. Insertion order is not maintained
 3. Most widely used map

LinkedHashMap:
 1. LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order.
 2. Insertion speed is same as HashMap
 3. Retrieval is the slowest one.

TreeMap:
 1. Data is sorted based on natural order(ascending 0-9. a-z)
 2. Insertion is Slowest because of the sorting

HashTable:
 1. Is a thread safe data means it can handle multiple insertions and retrievals
 at the same time from multiple CPU cores but because  of thread safety feature it is also very slow ,
 so if you are sure that you will never write multithreading code ever
